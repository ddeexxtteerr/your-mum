Thankfully I had the beam sword a lot more which allowed me to work through some rooms a lot faster than usual. Skipped the heart in 8. At times my scrolling was good and other times I had a hard time landing on the correct pixel or messed up the one frame input. I did minor counting in order to get some forced drops and other times forgot where I was in the count. I grabbed the potion before 9, but only used it once which saved some time. I wanted more bombs going into 9 and was not keeping track of counts and had to rely on a random drop which took more time. Overall I am pleased with this performance and thinking of making more adjustments to carve out some more time.

Apparently OBS didn't pick up any sound whatsoever. That's what I get for plonking around with sound settings and trying to set up particular audio exclusions (due to last PB having audio from a stream I had open).

Didn't help that i lost my last 4 runs that got past lvl 8 with deaths in lvl 9. Including one occassion where i was holding a blue potion while fighting Gannon but didn't use it... 

I'm quite happy with this time. My Darknuts rooms have improved quite a bit. Another route would probably help but i don't feel comfortable with the routes that require screenscroll glitch. During this run i even opted out of the blockpass glitch in 5 even tough i always took it (after way too many attempts most of the time).

If the YouTube timestamp doesn't work, go to 4:31:37 on the stream.

Now, I would have had audio for the recording, but Xsplit broke my local recording, via segmenting it about an hour into the stream, and corrupting the rest of the local VOD to be unplayable or convertable to save the audio. I have to go by the archived YouTube stream as a result of this, which due to being forced to use free license Xsplit due to poverty PC, YouTube (and Twitch, nevertheless) doesn't support the Speex audio codec Xsplit forces, and thus there is no audio on the video, yet video is intact. I cannot run OBS as my PC's GPU just falls short of supporting the full DirectX 10 instruction set required to run, preview anything, or even record, no matter what version of OBS I grab.

First split is really good, then got trolled by viridian forest and 3 encounters.

Nido is like 16/13/14/13 at 8, following split is good, and straight to the Mt Tilt with no paras.

Played safe vs Misty because hype, forced to get farfetch'd, great cans and then the 2 mistakes happened.

Loss of focus, I used a repel after getting the bike. (10 seconds lost because of an encounter). But I also fought one hiker that I should have dodged I don't know how, just failed ... 30-40s lost)

The end of the run was good. So I guess with no tilt in Mt Moon, Viridian and no loss of focus I  should have done 1:30~1:40 better.

This is my first real attempt at a run with the prep of watching some streams over the past year, and reading a guide for a bit this morning. As a first try I'm pretty happy with the time, though there are multiple mistakes throughout, so hey! Plenty of opportunities to improve! 

I have to apologise as the split times are nonsensical on the video towards the end as I kept forgetting to split so a lot of them are off by a few mins. I've put the real split times below manually.

If you see me stop, I've probably forgotten what's next (or am i going so fast you can't even read my inputs?) . Wouldn't recommend this if you're looking to see it done properly!

Run 2 of Pokemon Red. Manage to make a whole catalogue of new mistakes this time round. A silly death and missing a PP UP made me have to think off route which is probably good for me in these early runs to be fair. Saved 1:46 though! 

I only missed a couple split timers this time but more annoyingly I thought I fixed the splits to switch around Blaine & Erika and add a Giovanni last night but half way through the realised the changes must not have saved. 

Getting towards the end of a run with your timer just ahead of your current PB is so exciting. Enjoying this and hope there will be more.

This is my 3rd full recorded run and the time is coming down nicely. This is the first time I did the Nidoran manipulation and I think the time save speaks for itself (got it first time.... totes didn't DAB)  *spoiler alert* I die to Lance and was so yolo I didn't save before him since I did at Bruno so was painfully close to a 2hr 10. 

There were still silly mistakes as I die to Misty without saving too. I hit extra trainers on the way to shop (part accident part will i have enough money) I manage to scrape by by selling potions to get the 1 important X Special.

Finally got sub 14. The RNG in this route is so back breaking sometimes.

Overall I think this was a solid attempt; was able to make a lot of time on this run. I'm still very iffy with button inputs during CoolTrainer; I always feel like I'm somehow gonna' softlock the game. I definitely feel like I need to menu better during that part.

Also I had to view F4's stats twice; didn't mash fast enough. That was really disheartening.

My splits were comparing against my sum of bests.

Splits are off by 1 after coast_10, my coast_11 split disappeared somehow.

Canals_11 and 12 were just awful in general.

A list of things that went wrong just on c17_13: (1) Got the double boost on 4th try. (2) Got the +walk abh 2nd try after accidentally saving mid air. (3) My smg nade boosted me above ground?! (4) I quick-saved a frame before the backup grenade went off causing me to save/load straight down. (5) Coincidentally had to use save deletion to restart c17_13 from the beginning; and (6) I really screwed up the +walk abh on the 2nd round through.

On Breen_01 I managed to do a fast strat first try, but unfortunately one of the gunships was flying way lower than they ever should and managed to kill me many many times before I could reset properly.

My absolute best PB at the time was around 5:10, but due to variety of factors (no video camera, capture card, really shitty internet and being a stupid kid) no record exists of it. 

Recently, Summoning Salt's video on the world record inspired me to try speedrunning once again. 

Turns out that the years have taken their toll and I've become really shitty. Input lag from the emulator, also doesn't help much.

I aimed for a sub 6 minute run to restart my speedrunning ""career"", but I'll get what I can.

I fucked up with timing my splits after 4-2, got distracted and died once. Also I didn't think I'll finish the run at all, so I played very carefully and leisurely, at a very grandmotherly pace. There is a very large room for improvement, though.

I have been running this game since the 8th of December 2015. Back then, 4:57 was a far off imaginary thought, one that I'd never expect to actually happen.

Now that dream has become a reality.

Huge thanks to everyone in the Super Mario Bros. community for being the best damn people ever. Without the kindness of everyone I doubt I would've ever gotten into this game.

Final thanks goes to zallard1. The man who hosted darbian that fateful night in 2015.  He is the main reason I am here today.

I chose SMB to begin because it's a short run, even though it's not easy. After watching lots of other runners and practising I was finally able to complete an entire run of the game in less than 6 minutes. It took me more than 300 attempts but I think it's quite remarkable after less than a week of practicing. 

Unfortunately, something happened to OBS and I don't have the video, I swear I was recording, but I only have a print screen now. I'll figure out what happened later to avoid problems with new PBs. 

I haven't even tried the hard tricks such as the flagpole skips, the bullet bill glitch and the pipe jumps. My goal in this game is to get closer to a 5 minute run.

I got 4:57.776 in April and my goal was 4th place, then that changed to 5th place because Stuckinaplate got a 4:56.

I was grinding up until June, having more than five 4:57's, none beating that PB.  When June ended and school was out, I took a break. That break lasted until last week, when I finally played again. 

Cut to 2 days ago, I started doing some offline attempts because streaming was pretty distracting. Not too long in I get a run to 8-4! 

Sadness ensues, it wasn't meant to be that day. Got ejected at the end of 8-4 water section. 

Then the next, I did more offline attempts. Another run to 8-4! Joyous days! That joy was short lived though, it died to frame perfect jump.

Then finally, today. More offline attempts today, and what do you know, a run to 8-4. This one was different though.

I actually beat the game this time.

The video included is the ""prettiest"" I have which includes a timer, but I have also uploaded the original cut-off recording through OBS (https://www.twitch.tv/videos/185672578) as well as a ""proof"" video which includes the full timer side-by-side with the cutoff timer, which I started by pressing SPACE activating both VLC player and livesplit on the frame before controlling mario (https://www.twitch.tv/videos/185675057)

The split file is from the OLD pb of 5:34 - in the process of uploading the new file, I managed to overwrite it with the old one.

In short, I made a late 5:15, but if I screwed up too badly for it to be verified, I understand :) It will be my penance for not checking OBS' display - I will hopefully beat it anyway before too long, and it was an awful 8-4.

Here it is. The legendary 4:57. Today was my first day playing with -7.12, and I did three attempts. The first attempt missed BBG entirely. The second attempt had bad judges, but I got BBG. That run died to Bowser's hammers in 8-4. But then, something happened.

I got a run with good judges, optimal BBG, and 1 frame walljump.

This has been the PB I have put the most time in practice and dedication to achieve! I practiced for several hours prior to starting this stream on just the last level alone and it paid off! 
I did get to 8-4 on pace 1 time before this run during this session and i didn't even get the walljump. Luckily 2nd try worked and it got to the end! 
The fight is not over though! Now I can finally confidently begin to do attempts with Flagpole Glitch to save an extra framerule or 21 frames/ 0.35 seconds. The reason I wanted this PB even though it wasn't my ultimate goal is because I didn't like the feeling that I still had so much time to save in 8-4. But now that I closed the gap a little I can rest easy having a PB with a respectable finish. More runs to come!

Stuff I Can Improve:
1-1 (mostly the pipe) can be practiced more. 
1-2 is pretty good, other than the elevator platforms.
4-2 is the main area of improvement, I ended up just going up the vine in the end. 
8-1, 8-2, and 8-3 are going to end up biting me in the back, as there was many minor mistakes that could be improved on later. 
8-4 was the most important level (duh), so I was hyped when it was finally over. However, the water level was slow, so this run could be redone in the future.

The acual delay in livesplit would be -3.98 but I changed it because I am using a different SMB1 version but It should be the same as -3.98 on a other version of the game. (I tested it)
I lost at least one framerule in 8-1. Still a good run.
sorry about the splits: I was typing something in a twich chat and I accidentally overwrote the spilt but you should see it with a program that can see the other splits.
